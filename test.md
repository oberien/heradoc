## Code Formatting

### Rust

Some rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let foo = bar();
}
```

### Sequence Diagram?

In the future possibly a sequence diagram.

```sequence
uiae
```

### Graphviz

See the generated graphviz output in [#graphviz];

```graphviz,#graphviz,caption=Fancy Graph,width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.5\textwidth,scale=0.4
digraph FancyGraph {
    splines=ortho;
    
    start[label="Start Project"];
    right_or_fast[label="Do things\nright or do\nthem fast?", shape="diamond"];
    well[label="Code Well"]
    done_well[label="Are you\ndone yet?", shape="diamond"];
    away[label="Throw it all out\nand start over"];
    fast[label="Code Fast"];
    done_fast[label="Does it\nwork yet?", shape="diamond"];
    
    start -> right_or_fast;
    right_or_fast -> well[label="Right"];
    well -> done_well;
    done_well -> well[label="No"];
    done_well -> away[label="No, and the\nrequirements\nhave changed."];
    right_or_fast -> fast[label="Fast"];
    fast -> done_fast;
    done_fast -> fast[label="No"];
    done_fast -> away[label="Almost, but it's\nbecome a mass\nof kludges and\nspaghetti code."];
    away -> start;
}
```

### Python

At least we already have python:

```python
def foo():
    if True:
        print(1337)
foo()
```

This is hopefully an image with a title which is used as label, such that I can reference it here as [#placeholdit].

A biber reference with page: [@foo 1337].  
A biber reference with multiple pages: [@foo 42-69, 112].
