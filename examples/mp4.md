# The basics
## Introduction

```espeak
Hello. Today, we will see something awesome. We know already that Heradoc is
useful for quickly creating feature rich presentations in an academic setting
where graphcs, code, and formulas are an absolute must. But now, we truly
witness the next leap.
```

Markdown + Text + TextToSpeech = awesome

## Motivation and the fundamental attribution error

```espeak
How did this project happen? There are a few causes that come to mind. First of
all, the coronavirus quarantine necessitating video conferences and canceling
all other presentations. Secondly, I recently got aware of someone posting
something like this in a software as a service model over the internet. This
waste of resources, privacy, and general finess _must_ be fought and what
better way than make it available with a libre Markdown converter? But let's
not forget another grave factor, that I can't control myself and waste time on
project such as these that have little real personal gains.

But that does not really explain it. The reality is probably even more
complicated. You almost surely underestimate the situational explanations
leading to this situation, and so do I. Think about it, what are the chances
that some developer for an infant obscure program for personal sue took the
time to hack together text-to-speech just for the sake of making a single
presentation as an april's fool joke? Jeez.
```

How did this project ever happen?

* The coronavirus quarantine
* Someone offering this via the internet as software as a service
* A distaste for spending my time sensibly

# What we use language for
## An ode to TTS

```espeak
Humans like to communicate through speech, it allows us to articular our most
profound ideas. Through conversation do we birth fantastical ideas. And true
masters, poets, gain eternal life. But humans are fallible. In comparison, Text
to speech can't fail. Unlike humans it does not get ill. It is consistent, it
does not make mistakes:

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. How many pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick?

That wasn't so hard now, was it?

It's never gonna give you up,
never gonna let you down,
never gonna run around and desert you.
```

Language is a powerful way of conveying ideas.

Poets are under the most well-known historical figures for a reason.

## And this is where we get meta

```espeak
But language is also a great tool for deception. It can be used for evil. Did
any of this talk make sense to you? Maybe it shouldn't. When DeepL and other
neural networks can create good translations themselves how hard can it be to
run some final style checks on a finished script to ensure it aligns to a
message regardless of the actual author, who may be a poor mechanical turk
somewhere? A very bad example:

Hello, fellow [NON HETEROSEXUAL]. It is us, [MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION]. Here
to remind you that we support your lifestyle now that it has been federally
legalised and it is completely socially safe, allowing for us to capitalise on
your existence now it's mainstream. Look, we even changed the colours of
[LOGO]! Why did we wait this long to come out and 'support' you? Haha, no more
questions, [FELLOW HUMAN]. Buy our product. Buy our product. BUY OUR PRODUCT.
```

It's a tool to be coaxed and deceived. Not always maliciously.

A small amount of lies mixed with truth is very effective.
