# Inline Formatting

## Bold

Markdown joke? That's **bold**!

## Italic

Part of this text *is italic*.

## Inline Code

In rust, the entry point of a program with std is `fn main() {â€¦}`.
If inline code starts with a special meta char followed by a space, it can have other meanings:

* `$`: This is math mode `$ \alpha \beta \gamma`.
* `\`: This is inline-latex `\ \textbf{foo} \textit{bar} \texttt{baz}`.
